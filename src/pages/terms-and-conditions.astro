			<h3>12.2. CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS</h3>
			<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party will be liable for any incidental, special or consequential loss or damages, or third-party reputational damage arising from the Client's use of the goods or services, or damages for loss of data, business or business opportunity, goodwill, anticipated savings, profits or revenue in connection with these Terms or any goods or services provided by us, except:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>in relation to a party's liability for fraud, personal injury, death or loss or damage to tangible property; or</li>
				<li>to the extent this liability cannot be excluded under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>13. UPGRADES AND DOWNGRADES</h2>
			<p>The Client may notify the Provider that it would like to upgrade or downgrade its Subscription Tier at any time, and the Client must do so if the Number of Licensed Users changes such that the Client's use of the Solution falls into a new Subscription Tier.</p>
			<p>If the Client provides a notice under clause 14(a), or the Provider otherwise becomes aware that the Client's use of the Solution has changed such that it falls into a new Subscription Tier, the Provider will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>take reasonable steps to promptly provide the Client with access to the new Subscription Tier; and</li>
				<li>in the monthly billing cycle immediately following the month in which the Client's access to the new Subscription Tier was provided (First Access Month):
					<ul>
						<li>charge the Client the new, relevant Subscription Fee for that subsequent month (Second Access Month), and each subsequent month (subject to another notice or change under this clause 14); and</li>
						<li>if the Subscription Fee for the Second Access Month is higher than in the First Access Month, then the Provider will charge the Client the new, relevant Subscription Fee for the proportion of the First Access Month that the Client had access to the new Subscription Tier, on a pro rata basis.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For the avoidance of doubt, if the Client chooses to downgrade its Subscription Tier, the new Fees will kick in at the start of the next billing cycle, unless the Provider notifies the Client otherwise. The Provider generally does not pro-rate downgrades in between billing cycles, however the Provider reserves the right to do so from time to time.</p>
			<p>These Terms will be taken to be amended in accordance with any changes agreed in accordance with this clause 14.</p>

			<h2>14. TERMINATION</h2>
			<h3>14.1. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE</h3>

			</ul>
			<p>(together, the Outstanding Amounts)</p>
			<p>The Client will pay the Outstanding Amounts to the Provider within a further 10 Business Days after the End Date, unless otherwise agreed in a written payment plan between the parties.</p>
			<p>Any pre-estimated losses in clause 14.1 will not limit or otherwise effect the Provider's rights under this agreement, at law or otherwise in equity; the Provider's losses resulting from the Client's breach are likely to far exceed its losses resulting from termination for the Client's convenience.</p>

			<h3>14.2. TERMINATION FOR BREACH</h3>
			<p>If a party (the Notifying Party) considers that the other party is in breach of this agreement (the Breach), the Notifying Party may provide a notice to the other party.</p>
			<p>The notice must include the nature and details of the Breach, with reference to the relevant clause/s of this agreement. The Notifying Party may, if it wishes to do so, make suggestions for resolving the Breach.</p>
			<p>The other party will have 10 Business Days (or longer, as per the Notifying Party's discretion) to rectify the Breach (the Rectification Period).</p>
			<p>After the Rectification Period, the Notifying Party will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>if the Breach has been successfully rectified, notify the other party that the agreement will continue; or</li>
				<li>if the Breach has not been successfully rectified, notify the other party that this agreement is terminated (Termination for Breach Notice).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Following a Termination for Breach Notice, the parties will stop all work under this agreement unless otherwise agreed.</p>
			<p>Any disputes regarding termination under this clause must be dealt with in accordance with clause 16. The indemnities, warranties and liability caps in clause 12 will apply to any disputes and resulting claims.</p>
			<p>Where the Notifying Party is the Provider and the Provider provides a Termination for Breach Notice, the Provider will provide along with such notice, an invoice for any Outstanding Amounts. The Client will pay the Outstanding Amounts to the Provider within 10 Business Days after the Termination for Breach Notice is provided, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing to a payment plan.</p>

			<h3>14.3. OTHER CONSEQUENCES FOR TERMINATION</h3>
			<p>If this agreement ends, in addition to the specific consequences set out in clause 14.1 or 14.2 (as applicable), the parties will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>return all property and Confidential Information to the other party;</li>
				<li>where applicable, the Client must remove the Software from all its computer systems;</li>
				<li>comply with all obligations that are by their nature intended to survive the end of this agreement, including without limitation clauses 13 and 8; and</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>14.4. DATA BACKUP</h3>
			<p>Upon termination or expiry of this agreement, the Provider may delete data and material associated with the Client, including Client Data, 3 months after the end of the Term.</p>
			<p>The Provider will not be able to recover any such data or content more than 14 days after the end of the Term, so it is recommended that the Client backs up anything important to it.</p>
			<p>The Provider will not be responsible to the Client, or any user, for, and The Provider expressly disclaims any liability for, any cost, loss, damages or expenses arising out the cancellation, termination or expiry of this agreement and any loss of data.</p>
			<p>This clause shall apply to the extent of any applicable laws or regulations that require the Provider to retain the Client Data.</p>

			<h2>15. IF THE PARTIES HAVE A DISPUTE</h2>
			<p>If an issue between the parties arises under this agreement that cannot be resolved day-to-day, the parties will make genuine efforts in good faith to participate cooperatively in mediation, at equal shared expense of the parties.</p>
			<p>The parties will conduct mediation through the Australian Disputes Centre (ADC) and in accordance with the ADC's Guidelines for Commercial Mediation (as current at the time of the dispute).</p>
			<p>The parties will follow the mediator's recommendations on the extent of mediation required, and when to stop mediation if the issue cannot be resolved.</p>
			<p>If mediation does not resolve the issue, the parties must:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>if they haven't already done so, engage independent legal representation at their own expense to understand the strength of their arguments; and</li>
				<li>based on that advice, if settlement is not achieved, participate in arbitration (or other dispute resolution mechanism agreed in mediation) through the ADC at equal shared expense.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The parties will follow the binding outcome of arbitration (or other agreed mechanism).</p>
			<p>Either party may at any time during this process make an offer for settlement. The parties acknowledge and agree it is in their best interests to properly consider all genuine settlement offers. The parties will use best endeavours to avoid litigation and reach a prompt settlement.</p>

			<p>The notice will be considered to be delivered 24 hours after it was sent, unless the sender has reason to believe the email failed to send or was otherwise not delivered or received.</p>
