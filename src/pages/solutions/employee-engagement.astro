  faq1Question="How is this different from Culture Amp or Lattice?"
  faq1Answer="Unlike traditional survey platforms that ask the same questions repeatedly, Hoogly uses AI conversations to uncover the 'why' behind employee sentiment. Instead of just measuring engagement, we help you build it through continuous listening and actionable insights."

  faq2Answer="Most organizations are live with their first pulse survey within 30 minutes. Our AI handles the heavy lifting, so you can focus on what matters most - your people."
  faq3Question="Is it truly anonymous?"
  faq3Answer="Yes. Hoogly runs in 'Incognito Mode' - we never store personally identifiable information alongside responses. Data is encrypted and aggregated, ensuring individual voices stay protected while you get clear insights."
