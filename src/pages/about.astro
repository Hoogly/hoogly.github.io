      <h2 class="h2">Origins of the name 'Hoogly'</h2>
      <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: 1.5rem auto 0 auto; font-size: var(--font-size-lg); color: var(--color-neutral-700);">
        Hoogly is inspired by the Danish concept of Hygge (hyoo-guh)—a feeling of cozy contentment, like a warm hug for your soul. Hygge is about slowing down and savoring simple moments, whether with others or in peaceful solitude.<br/><br/>
        We believe that these moments of connection—of togetherness—are a vital part of being human, and of working well with others. Throughout history, people have gathered around campfires, coffee tables, or water coolers at work, finding comfort and camaraderie. Even when work became more remote and teams spread out, this need for connection didn't disappear.<br/><br/>
        Hoogly exists to bring that sense of Hygge back to the modern workplace—a virtual space where you can find the warmth, trust, and belonging we all crave, no matter where you are.
