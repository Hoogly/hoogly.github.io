# What Gets Rewarded, Gets Repeated

## Rethinking success in leadership and the cultures we unintentionally create.

**Excerpt:** Every leader shapes culture, whether they mean to or not. Through what we reward, ignore, celebrate, or tolerate, we signal what matters. Too often, we unknowingly reward burnout, over-functioning, or urgency. This piece invites leaders to reflect on what they're reinforcing and offers practical tools to build more human-centered, sustainable cultures.

You can tell a lot about a company by what it celebrates.

The late-night Slack message that gets public praise.

The heroic deadline push that salvaged a project.

The "all hands on deck" fire drill that wins applause.

At face value, it may look like success. But step back and ask:

**Are we rewarding courage—or over-functioning?**

**Are we celebrating clarity—or constant availability?**

**Are we building resilient teams—or reinforcing habits that lead to burnout?**

Because here's the truth:

**What gets rewarded gets repeated.**

And what gets repeated becomes your culture.

Not the vision statement.

Not the quarterly town hall.

But the day-to-day behaviors that quietly say: *This is who we are here.*

## Culture is Built-in Micro-Moments

Too often, companies think culture is something that lives in a deck or a brand document.

But culture is built in how leaders behave when no one's watching.

It lives in what gets attention and what goes unspoken.

It shows up in:

- How feedback is given
- Who gets praised—and why
- What's tolerated under pressure
- How success is measured

Every decision, every recognition, every response sends a message.

The question is: **Are you sending the message you intend to?**

## What Are You Really Reinforcing?

Leaders often say they value wellbeing, trust, and inclusion—but still reward:

- Always-on availability
- Heroic over-delivery
- Speed over intentionality
- Exhaustion masked as dedication

These signals create dissonance.

People hear one thing but feel another.

And over time, that erodes trust.

## Leading by Design, Not Default

The most impactful leaders don't just set a vision; they model what's valued through their presence and their practices.

Here are three culture-shaping practices to implement across any team:

### 1. Redefine Success Markers

Most teams measure output. But healthy cultures also measure how the work is done.

Try adding qualitative success markers like:

- "We stayed aligned with our values"
- "We communicated clearly and early"
- "We protected deep focus"
- "We made space for thoughtful dissent"

**Success isn't just what you deliver—it's how you deliver it.**

### 2. Celebrate Process, Not Just Outcome

Many teams rush from launch to launch without reflection. But the most sustainable cultures build in meaning.

After key projects, debrief with:

- What did we learn—not just what did we achieve?
- Where did we grow as a team?
- Who embodied the values we want to scale?

**Celebrate progress and presence—not just performance.**

### 3. Audit What You Reward

Look at recent recognitions, performance reviews, or informal praise.

Ask:

- Are we unintentionally rewarding overwork or reactivity?
- Are our rituals reinforcing urgency or spaciousness?
- Are we lifting up healthy boundaries as success stories?

If the answer isn't aligned with your vision, you have an opportunity—not a failure—to reset.

## A Culture Worth Staying For

People don't burn out because they don't care.

They burn out because they care about systems that don't protect or model sustainability.

The cultures that thrive in the long term are those that honor both excellence and humanity.

So ask yourself—and your leadership team:

**What are we rewarding?**

**What are we repeating?**

**And is it building the culture we actually want to lead?**
